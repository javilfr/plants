# Spec: Tool Functions

**File:** `tools.py`
**Status:** `get_seasonal_conditions` — Pre-implemented, read through. `lookup_plant` — complete spec fields before implementing.

---

## Purpose

These two functions are the tools the agent can call. They retrieve structured data from the local plant database and seasonal data files and return it to the agent loop, which passes it to the LLM as context for generating a response.

---

## Function 1: `lookup_plant()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `plant_name` | `str` | The plant name as entered by the user or chosen by the LLM — may be any casing, common name, scientific name, or alias |

**Output:** `dict`

When the plant is **found**, return:
```python
{"found": True, "plant": <the full plant dict from _plant_db>}
```

When the plant is **not found**, return:
```python
{"found": False, "name": <normalized input>, "message": <helpful string>}
```

---

### Design Decisions

*Complete the two blank fields below before writing code. The others are pre-filled for you.*

---

#### Input normalization

Strip leading/trailing whitespace and convert to lowercase before any comparison.

```python
normalized = plant_name.strip().lower()
```

---

#### Search order

Search in this order: direct key → display name → scientific name → aliases.
Keys are the fastest lookup (O(1) dict access), so check those first. Display
names are the next most likely match for clean user input. Scientific names
matter because the tool definition tells the LLM it can pass them. Aliases are
the broadest net, so they go last.

```
1. Direct key match: normalized in _plant_db
2. Display name match: plant["display_name"].lower() == normalized
3. Scientific name match: plant["scientific_name"].lower() == normalized
4. Alias match: normalized in [alias.lower() for alias in plant["aliases"]]
```

---

#### Alias matching approach

*Aliases are stored as a list of strings. How will you check if the normalized input matches any alias in the list? Write your approach in pseudocode or plain English.*

```
For each plant in _plant_db.values():
    Lowercase every alias string and build a temporary list.
    If normalized input is in that list → match found, return the plant.

In Python: normalized in [alias.lower() for alias in plant["aliases"]]
```

---

#### Not-found message

*When a plant isn't found, the agent will read your message and use it to decide what to tell the user. Write the exact string you'll return — make it useful to the agent, not just to a human reading logs.*

```
f"No plant named '{plant_name}' was found in the database. "
f"Plants currently in the database: {available}. "
"Offer general care advice based on what the user describes, and let them know their plant isn't in the database."
```

The message includes: (1) the unrecognized name so the agent can echo it back, (2) the full list of available plants so the agent can suggest the closest match, and (3) an explicit instruction on how to handle the gap.

---

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and running the app.*

**Test: does `"devil's ivy"` return the pothos entry?**
```
yes — alias scan finds "devil's ivy" in pothos["aliases"], returns {"found": True, "plant": pothos_dict}
```

**Test: does `"SNAKE PLANT"` return the snake plant entry?**
```
yes — display_name.lower() == "snake plant", returns {"found": True, "plant": snake_plant_dict}
```

**One edge case you discovered while implementing:**
```
The model may send plant names like "Monstera deliciosa" (scientific name with capital) or
"devil's ivy" (alias with apostrophe). Both are handled by normalizing to lowercase before
any comparison. A subtle issue: the slug keys use underscores (e.g. "snake_plant") but users
never type underscores — that's why the display_name and alias passes are essential even
though slug lookup is technically O(1).
```

## Function 2: `get_seasonal_conditions()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `season` | `str \| None` | One of `"spring"`, `"summer"`, `"fall"`, `"winter"`, or `None` to auto-detect |

**Output:** `dict`

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus one additional field:

| Added field | Type | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| `"detected_season"` | `bool` | `True` if auto-detected from the month; `False` if season was passed as an argument |

---

### Design Decisions

*This function is pre-implemented — read through these fields and the code before working on `lookup_plant`.*

---

#### Auto-detection logic

When `season` is `None`, get the current calendar month with `datetime.now().month`
and look it up in the `_MONTH_TO_SEASON` dict, which maps month numbers to season strings.

```python
current_month = datetime.now().month
season_key = _MONTH_TO_SEASON[current_month]
```

---

#### Season validation

If the caller passes an invalid season string (e.g., `"monsoon"`), the function
falls back to auto-detection — same as if `None` were passed. The `VALID_SEASONS`
set acts as the gate:

```python
VALID_SEASONS = {"spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"}
if season and season.lower() in VALID_SEASONS:
    ...  # use provided season
else:
    ...  # auto-detect
```

---

#### Return structure

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus a `detected_season` boolean. Example for spring:

```python
{
    "name": "Spring",
    "watering": "Increase watering frequency as plants break dormancy ...",
    "fertilizing": "Resume feeding with a balanced fertilizer ...",
    "light": "Days are lengthening — move plants closer to windows ...",
    "pests": "Watch for spider mites and aphids as temperatures rise ...",
    "detected_season": True   # True = auto-detected; False = caller specified
}
```

---

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after testing.*

**Test: does calling with `season=None` return the correct season for the current month?**
```
Current month: June (6)
Expected season: summer
Returned season: Summer  ✓  (detected_season: True)
```

**Test: does calling with `season="winter"` return winter data regardless of the current month?**
```
yes — (detected_season: False confirms the caller-specified path was taken)
```
